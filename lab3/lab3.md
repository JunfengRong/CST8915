## Reflection Questions

1. What challenges did you encounter when configuring environment variables in the GitHub Actions workflow?
    I did not face any challenges when configuring environment variables in the Github Action Flow in this Lab, as I worked with Github Action many times before.




2. How does deploying microservices on Azure Web App Service differ from running them locally?
    Deploying microservices on Azure Web App Service differs from running them locally in several ways. First, Azure Web App Service allows you to scale your application horizontally by adding more instances. Secondly, it provides high availability with build-in features like load balancing and auto-scaling. Finally, it offers a fully managed environment for deploying and managing your microservices.
  

3. Why is it important to use environment variables for configurations in a cloud environment?
     Storing sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, and connection strings in environment variables helps prevent exposing them in your code or configuration files, and environment variables allow you to change configurations without modifying your code.
